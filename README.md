# Gaming Analytics SQL Project (MySQL)

This repository contains my Data Analytics Assignment 3 for FINA6204 — a SQL-based business intelligence project modeling a gaming environment inspired by Pokémon. It demonstrates how to design a relational schema, populate sample data, and write analytical SQL queries to extract actionable insights.

## Key Analyses
- **Average Pokémon stats by class** – balancing characters
- **Top 3 highest-selling Pokémon** – identifying revenue drivers
- **Average customer age & session time** – user demographics and engagement
- **Top performing builds & win rates** – game balancing
- **Segmentation by player rank** – loyalty analysis
- **Reward participation** – player targeting
- **Item pricing strategy** – minimum, mean, and maximum prices

## Skills Demonstrated
- Relational database modeling in MySQL / MySQL Workbench  
- Writing advanced SQL queries with joins, CTEs, and window functions  
- Business intelligence reporting and KPI development  
- Applying analytics to product, customer, and operational data  

## Files
- **BI Analytics.pdf** – Full report including schema, queries, and sample outputs
